# Find out that this person is single or not!

Analyze that this person is single or not by answering 5 questions.
1. How often do you go out?
2. What do you like to do in your free time?
3. Describe relationship with your parents?
4. Describe ideal vacation?
5. Describe how you usually spend Saturday evenings?

We surveyed 30 people and asked that they are single or not as a final question to make a sample group to train our model.
We used speech-to-text app in python to turn from speech to text when people answered, and then put it in Rstudio to structure the data.
